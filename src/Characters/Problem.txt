RPG Characters - Java
by CodeChum Admin

RPG, or Role Playing Games is one of my favorite types of game; I get to interact with other players! For this program, we will be implementing these characters.



Base Class - Character:

Private Properties:
private int health: The health of the character.
private int damage: The damage capability of the character.
private int shield: The shield strength of the character.
Constructor:
public Character(int health, int damage, int shield): Initializes the health, damage, and shield properties.
Getter Methods: For health, damage, and shield.
Setter Method: For health.
Method:
public void receiveDamage(int damage): Updates health by subtracting the difference between damage and shield. Prints "Character has died" if health drops to 0 or less.


Subclass - Swordsman (extends Character):

Constructor:
public Swordsman(): Calls the constructor of Character with 100 for health, 10 for damage, and 10 for shield.


Subclass - Paladin (extends Swordsman):

Additional Property:
boolean hasResurrected: Indicates if the Paladin has already resurrected once.
Constructor:
public Paladin(): Calls the constructor of Swordsman and initializes hasResurrected to false.
Methods:
@Override public void receiveDamage(int damage): If damage is even, divides it by 2 before reducing it by the shield and deducting from health. Calls resurrect() if health drops to 0 or less.
public void resurrect(): If hasResurrected is false, sets hasResurrected to true and restores health to 100. Otherwise, prints "Paladin has died".
